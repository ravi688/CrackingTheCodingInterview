// Self Balancing Tree : AVL Tree
// Description: Self-Balancing Trees are height-balanced binary search trees that automatically 
// keep the height as small as possible when insertion and deletion operations are performed on the trees.
// AVL tree have a property that the difference between the heights of left and right subtrees can't be more 
// than one. This property is ensured/maintain by rotations.
