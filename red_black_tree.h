// Self Balancing Tree : Red-Black Tree
// Description: Self-Balancing Trees are height-balanced binary search trees that automatically 
// keep the height as small as possible when insertion and deletion operations are performed on the trees.
// RB Trees take advantage of the property of BST to make rotations and eventually balance the tree.
